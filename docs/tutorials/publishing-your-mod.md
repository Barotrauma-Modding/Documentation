# Publishing Your Mod

Mods need to be shared with other players so that you can play together with them in multiplayer mode.

Fortunately, publishing a mod is fairly simple: first you need to go the the "Publish" tab in the Steam Workshop menu and select your newly created content package. The folder where the content package resides (for example, `InstallationLocation/Barotrauma/Mods/MyMod/`) and all its contents will be uploaded to the Workshop.

Make sure all the files required for your mod are present inside the folder: textures, audio, xml files and so on. Your content package can also reference content outside the mod's folder, but this content will not be uploaded into workshop â€” generally you would only do this if you want to make a core package that uses some of the vanilla files without having to bundle the vanilla files with your mod.

Once everything is ready, simply click `Publish item`. The mod should now be found in Steam workshop, where others can find and download it.
